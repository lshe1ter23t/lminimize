Step 0: extract the Crypto.com-API-JavaSctipt from github and save it on your desktop or anywhere you like.
Step 1: Install nodejs and npm if you haven't done that already. You could find documentation online on how to do it for Linux or Windows. I included couple sites below.

I cleared the data inside of it but yours should not be blank. To do that proceed to step 3

Step3: Create a service account. You are going to need this. the service account will look like an email that ends with gserviceaccount.com.
You will then "share" your google spreadsheet with this service account that you created. Similar how you share your googlesheet with a friend or colleague.
